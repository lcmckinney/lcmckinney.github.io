<h2>PURPOSE</h2>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<body>
    <p>I am a future graduate from the University of Oklahoma with two degrees in Accounting and Management Information Systems. For the past couple of years, I have been an accounting intern for Chickasaw Nation Industries. At CNI I gained valuable experience by simultaneously applying my classroom knowledge to real-world situations.</p>
    <p>I am passionate about data and the valuable information it can provide if properly organized and modeled. Especially with financial data, as it is key in making important business decisions. </p>
