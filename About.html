<h2>UPBRINGING</h2>
<body>
    <p>I was born and raised in the small town of Claremore, Oklahoma. I am the youngest among my three siblings. Both my brothers also studied at OU's Price College of Business. One majored in Accounting, the other in MIS. Unlike them, I couldn't choose just one.</p>
    <p>Originally I wanted to become a math educator because I absolutely loved the logic and absoluteness of math. Yet, I soon switched my major to Business Management after working at my first job and thinking "I could run this place better."</p>
    <p>Then, after a couple years at my local university I transferred to my dream college, The University of Oklahoma. Here, I took my first accounting class and didnt understand it at first, but quickly realized it was absolutely for me. I picked up a minor in MIS after taking my first MIS class, but as I took more classes, I became more and more intrigued, and the rest is history</p>

<h2>NOW</h2>
<body>
    <p>Being outside is always on my mind. I love rock climbing, hiking, backpacking, kyaking, hammocking, biking, skiing, camping, and everything in between.</p>
    <p>I am graduating this December (2020) with two degrees. One in Accounting and the other in Management Information Systems. I am just excited to offer value to companies by being able to connect these two very different worlds together.</p>
